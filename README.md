# template-node

A sane, opinionated template for esm node projects written in typescript.

For new, node 24+ projects.

Uses:

- [biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome) for linting and formatting
- [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) for linting commit messages
- [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for git hooks
- [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) for checks on commit
- [vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest) for testing
- [tsx](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx) for dev time typescript

## running

### `yarn dev`

Runs the project in watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds/transpiles the code to `./build`.

### `yarn start`

Runs the built project.

### `yarn test`

Runs tests.

### `yarn biome-fix`

Runs biome in fix mode (only [safe fixes](https://biomejs.dev/linter/#safe-fixes)) to lint and format the project.

### `yarn typecheck`

Runs type checking using tsc.

## vscode

You might want to install the recommended extensions in vscode. Search for **@recommended** in the extensions tab, they'll show up as _"workspace recommendations"_.

If you have been using eslint and prettier and their extensions, you might want to disable eslint entirely and keep prettier as the formatter only for certain types of files.

This is done by the `.vscode/settings.json` file.

Debug configurations are also included (for source using tsx and for bundle using the generated source maps).
